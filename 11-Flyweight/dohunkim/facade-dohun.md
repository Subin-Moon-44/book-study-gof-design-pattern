# Flyweight

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of c#
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.<sup>a)</sup>

&nbsp;
## 2. Structure
#### Class diagram

&nbsp;
## 3. Participants
- `Context`
    - The Context class contains the extrinsic state, unique across all original objects. When a context is paired with one of the flyweight objects, it represents the full state of the original object.
- `Flyweight Factory`
    - The Flyweight Factory manages a pool of existing flyweights. With the factory, clients don‚Äôt create flyweights directly. Instead, they call the factory, passing it bits of the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight. The factory looks over previously created flyweights and either returns an existing one that matches search criteria or creates a new one if nothing is found.
- `Flyweight`
    - The Flyweight class contains the portion of the original object‚Äôs state that can be shared between multiple objects. The same flyweight object can be used in many different contexts. The state stored inside a flyweight is called intrinsic. The state passed to the flyweight‚Äôs methods is called extrinsic.

&nbsp;
## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- Save lots of memory
