# Chain Of Responsibility

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of c#
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.<sup>a)</sup>

## 3. Participants
- `Handler`
    - The Handler declares the interface, common for all concrete handlers. It usually contains just a single method for handling requests, but sometimes it may also have another method for setting the next handler on the chain.
- `Base Handler`
    - The Base Handler is an optional class where you can put the boilerplate code that‚Äôs common to all handler classes.
    - Usually, this class defines a field for storing a reference to the next handler. The clients can build a chain by passing a handler to the constructor or setter of the previous handler. The class may also implement the default handling behavior: it can pass execution to the next handler after checking for its existence.
- `Concrete Handler`
    - Concrete Handlers contain the actual code for processing requests. Upon receiving a request, each handler must decide whether to process it and, additionally, whether to pass it along the chain.
    - Handlers are usually self-contained and immutable, accepting all necessary data just once via the constructor.
- `Client`
    - The Client may compose chains just once or compose them dynamically, depending on the application‚Äôs logic. Note that a request can be sent to any handler in the chain‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt have to be the first one.

## 4. Sample Code 
`Chain of responsibility`
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace RefactoringGuru.DesignPatterns.ChainOfResponsibility.Conceptual
{
    public interface IHandler
    {
        IHandler SetNext(IHandler handler);
        object Handle(object request);
    }

    abstract class AbstractHandler : IHandler
    {
        private IHandler _nextHandler;

        public IHandler SetNext(IHandler handler)
        {
            this._nextHandler = handler;
            return handler;
        }
        
        public virtual object Handle(object request)
        {
            if (this._nextHandler != null)
            {
                return this._nextHandler.Handle(request);
            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }

    class MonkeyHandler : AbstractHandler
    {
        public override object Handle(object request)
        {
            if ((request as string) == "Banana")
            {
                return $"Monkey: I'll eat the {request.ToString()}.\n";
            }
            else
            {
                return base.Handle(request);
            }
        }
    }

    class SquirrelHandler : AbstractHandler
    {
        public override object Handle(object request)
        {
            if (request.ToString() == "Nut")
            {
                return $"Squirrel: I'll eat the {request.ToString()}.\n";
            }
            else
            {
                return base.Handle(request);
            }
        }
    }

    class DogHandler : AbstractHandler
    {
        public override object Handle(object request)
        {
            if (request.ToString() == "MeatBall")
            {
                return $"Dog: I'll eat the {request.ToString()}.\n";
            }
            else
            {
                return base.Handle(request);
            }
        }
    }

    class Client
    {
        public static void ClientCode(AbstractHandler handler)
        {
            foreach (var food in new List<string> { "Nut", "Banana", "Cup of coffee" })
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Client: Who wants a {food}?");

                var result = handler.Handle(food);

                if (result != null)
                {
                    Console.Write($"   {result}");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"   {food} was left untouched.");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var monkey = new MonkeyHandler();
            var squirrel = new SquirrelHandler();
            var dog = new DogHandler();

            monkey.SetNext(squirrel).SetNext(dog);

            Console.WriteLine("Chain: Monkey > Squirrel > Dog\n");
            Client.ClientCode(monkey);
            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.WriteLine("Subchain: Squirrel > Dog\n");
            Client.ClientCode(squirrel);
        }
    }
}
```
Output
```
Chain: Monkey > Squirrel > Dog

Client: Who wants a Nut?
   Squirrel: I'll eat the Nut.
Client: Who wants a Banana?
   Monkey: I'll eat the Banana.
Client: Who wants a Cup of coffee?
   Cup of coffee was left untouched.

Subchain: Squirrel > Dog

Client: Who wants a Nut?
   Squirrel: I'll eat the Nut.
Client: Who wants a Banana?
   Banana was left untouched.
Client: Who wants a Cup of coffee?
   Cup of coffee was left untouched.

## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- Customize handling sequence.
- Single Responsibility Principle by decoupling.

### Cons üëé
- Hard to deal with error handling.
- Hard to debug when design is not properly done.
