# Command

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of c#
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.<sup>a)</sup>

## 3. Participants
- `Sender(Invoker)`
    - The Sender class (aka invoker) is responsible for initiating requests. This class must have a field for storing a reference to a command object. The sender triggers that command instead of sending the request directly to the receiver. Note that the sender isn‚Äôt responsible for creating the command object. Usually, it gets a pre-created command from the client via the constructor.
- `Command`
    - The Command interface usually declares just a single method for executing the command.
- `Concrete Commands`
    - Concrete Commands implement various kinds of requests. A concrete command isn‚Äôt supposed to perform the work on its own, but rather to pass the call to one of the business logic objects. However, for the sake of simplifying the code, these classes can be merged.
    - Parameters required to execute a method on a receiving object can be declared as fields in the concrete command. You can make command objects immutable by only allowing the initialization of these fields via the constructor.
- `Receiver`
    - The Receiver class contains some business logic. Almost any object may act as a receiver. Most commands only handle the details of how a request is passed to the receiver, while the receiver itself does the actual work.
- `Receiver`
    - The Receiver class contains some business logic. Almost any object may act as a receiver. Most commands only handle the details of how a request is passed to the receiver, while the receiver itself does the actual work.
- `Client`
    - The Client creates and configures concrete command objects. The client must pass all of the request parameters, including a receiver instance, into the command‚Äôs constructor. After that, the resulting command may be associated with one or multiple senders.

## 4. Sample Code 
`Chain of responsibility`
```c#
using System;

namespace RefactoringGuru.DesignPatterns.Command.Conceptual
{
    public interface ICommand
    {
        void Execute();
    }

    class SimpleCommand : ICommand
    {
        private string _payload = string.Empty;

        public SimpleCommand(string payload)
        {
            this._payload = payload;
        }

        public void Execute()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"SimpleCommand: See, I can do simple things like printing ({this._payload})");
        }
    }

    class ComplexCommand : ICommand
    {
        private Receiver _receiver;
        private string _a;
        private string _b;

        public ComplexCommand(Receiver receiver, string a, string b)
        {
            this._receiver = receiver;
            this._a = a;
            this._b = b;
        }

        public void Execute()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("ComplexCommand: Complex stuff should be done by a receiver object.");
            this._receiver.DoSomething(this._a);
            this._receiver.DoSomethingElse(this._b);
        }
    }

    class Receiver
    {
        public void DoSomething(string a)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Receiver: Working on ({a}.)");
        }

        public void DoSomethingElse(string b)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Receiver: Also working on ({b}.)");
        }
    }

    class Invoker
    {
        private ICommand _onStart;
        private ICommand _onFinish;

        public void SetOnStart(ICommand command)
        {
            this._onStart = command;
        }

        public void SetOnFinish(ICommand command)
        {
            this._onFinish = command;
        }

        public void DoSomethingImportant()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invoker: Does anybody want something done before I begin?");
            if (this._onStart is ICommand)
            {
                this._onStart.Execute();
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Invoker: ...doing something really important...");
            Console.WriteLine("Invoker: Does anybody want something done after I finish?");
            if (this._onFinish is ICommand)
            {
                this._onFinish.Execute();
            }
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The client code can parameterize an invoker with any commands.
            Invoker invoker = new Invoker();
            invoker.SetOnStart(new SimpleCommand("Say Hi!"));
            Receiver receiver = new Receiver();
            invoker.SetOnFinish(new ComplexCommand(receiver, "Send email", "Save report"));

            invoker.DoSomethingImportant();
        }
    }
}
```
Output
```
Invoker: Does anybody want something done before I begin?
SimpleCommand: See, I can do simple things like printing (Say Hi!)
Invoker: ...doing something really important...
Invoker: Does anybody want something done after I finish?
ComplexCommand: Complex stuff should be done by a receiver object.
Receiver: Working on (Send email.)
Receiver: Also working on (Save report.)
```

## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- You can implement deferred execution of operations.
-  You can assemble a set of simple commands into a complex one.

### Cons üëé
- The code may become more complicated since you‚Äôre introducing a whole new layer between senders and receivers.
- Hard to debug when the code gets complicated.
